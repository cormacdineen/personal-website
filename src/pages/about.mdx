## Who do you think you are, I am!

I'm Cormac Dineen, I'm a full-time Mechanical engineering PhD student at the University of Bath investigating new quantitative approaches to uncertainty analysis for carbon footprinting and LCA. Prior to that I spent nearly 7 years as a Sustainability Consultant working with companies to measure and report on their climate impacts. I original trained as a chemical engineer, but realised that I don't like spending time in factories which turned out to be a tremendous obsticle to a career in that field.

I'm mainly using this site to post about my [research](https://orcid.org/0009-0006-5969-2226). With complexity of academic research publications on the march and attention spans in retreat, I thought it would be a useful exercise to summarise some of my work more plainly here. I also intend to write short pieces about any meaningless topic that interests me.
Outside of work, I maintain loose levels of commitment to a variety of things including sport, reading, listening to music and underseasoning food. To that end, I'll be posting about my cultural stew (anything I've watched, read, attended or tried and feel like recommending or pillorying). I've also started taking pretentious photos of late and will post them here too.

## Research interests

- Uncertainty associated with material provenence in complex supply chains
- Bayesian inference and combining top down and bottom up carbon data to quantify uncertainty
- Python and AI for research

## Public service announcement

The words on this site will always be 100% free of AI slop (although AI will help me develop and maintain the site itself). If minor typos and grammatical errors are unpalletable to you, you're cordially invited to take a walk.
